#Agenda: 
   1.Setup Github Repository
   ---Now in VS Code------
   2.New Environment 
     {command to create environment: <conda create -p venv python==3.9 -y>}
     {command to activate environment: <conda activate venv/>}
   3.Setup.py
     "With the help of setup.py we can build our entire Machine Learning Application as a package "
     After building setup.py file run command <pip install -r requirements.txt> to install the package.The 'e .'is                 indicating setup.py file and install the required package.
   4.Requirement.txt
   5. src folder (within this folder create __init__.py so that we can find src as a package, when setup.py(findpackages()) runs it can install packages.
      src(sorce is responsible for entire project development). Once Src folder runs and build it can install as a package like seaborn.

#Agenda: 
  1. Inside the src folder we create two folders: components and pipeline with __init__.py files 
  2. Within component folder create files Data Ingestion(we create here train and test of Data), Data Transformation, Moder Trainner(train the Model). These      all files are used as training purposes as within Pipeline folder we create another file i,e. Trainning Pipeline that is use to trigger(call) all components as training purposes.
  3. Also create two files in src folder i.e, exception.py & logger.py
